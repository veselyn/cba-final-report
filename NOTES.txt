Vesie's TODO:
1. give feedback about UX/UI section (tuesday)
2. prepare code snippets for each item on below list (thursday)
3. prepare a code snippet for one part of the code we want to showcase (thursday)

Tech Stack:
- EsLint
- Prettier
- TypeScript
- Docker compose
- Git
- GitHub Actions
- Postgres
- Kysely (migrations + seeding + query builder + code generation)
- NextJs (SSR + CSR)
- TailwindCSS
- ShadCN (ui components)

* why we have not followed the style guide?
* Vesie's argument: "I don't like the style guide"
* Vesie's argument: we wanted to move fast, we didnt care that much about the design, after we have an mvp, adapting the style guide to our product should be easier and faster because we have a centralised place to configure the design: edit component in the shadcn library under tailwind.config.ts
