        The focus of this final project for the Bachelor’s Degree in Web Development is the generation of Chronocademy, a web platform designed for skill exchange using time credits instead of money.
        At the outset, a product assessment phase was conducted using exploratory and qualitative research to analyze the challenges faced by individuals who struggle to access affordable education and those with skills to share but no structured way to do so.
        Based on these findings, a project management plan and a development model were designed to guide the creation of the platform, ensuring it meets user needs effectively.
        The resulting application aims to provide a collaborative and accessible learning environment, removing financial barriers and fostering skill-sharing.
        The platform’s success is measured through user feedback, focusing on satisfaction, usability, and the perceived value of time-based exchanges in education.
