\chapter{Project Development}\label{ch:project-development}

This chapter provides an in-depth look into the development of Chronocademy, outlining the key aspects that contributed to its creation.
The following sections will cover essential areas of the project, including product development, user experience, developer experience, the technologies used, and the code architecture.

Each of these areas played a critical role in shaping Chronocademy into a functional and user-friendly platform.
From defining the product's core features and refining its usability to selecting the right tools and structuring the codebase, this chapter highlights the processes and decisions that guided the project from concept to development.

By exploring these topics, the reader will gain a comprehensive understanding of how the team approached the challenges of building Chronocademy and the methods they used to ensure a robust, scalable, and well-designed platform.

\section{Product Development}\label{sec:productdevelopment}
The development of Chronocademy began by defining, refining, and prioritizing its core aspects and features.
This section outlines the step-by-step process undertaken to shape the product, ensuring it was both viable and aligned with the needs of its users.

\subsection{Defining the Idea through the Business Model Canvas}\label{subsec:business-model-canvas}
The first step in the product development journey was to define the core idea behind Chronocademy.
To structure and validate this concept, the team utilized the Business Model Canvas framework.

\begin{quote}
    ``The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management and entrepreneurial tool.
    It allows you to describe, design, challenge, invent, and pivot your business model.
    This method from the bestselling management book Business Model Generation is applied in leading organizations and start-ups worldwide.''
\end{quote}\cite{business-canvas-model}

This tool helped identify the key components of the platform, including the value proposition, target customer segments, revenue streams, cost structure, among others.
By analyzing these elements, the team was able to understand how Chronocademy would create, deliver, and capture value in a competitive landscape.
The structured approach of the Business Model Canvas ensured that the idea was not only innovative but also practical and sustainable.

After completing the Business Model Canvas, the team had a clear understanding of the platform's value proposition, target audience, revenue streams, and cost structure.
This work laid the groundwork for the subsequent stages of product development.

\subsection{Establishing the Brand: Colors, Logo, and Slogans}\label{subsec:colors-logo-slogans}
With the foundation of the business model in place, the next focus was on establishing a unique and memorable brand identity for Chronocademy.
The team selected a color palette that reflected the platformâ€™s values of knowledge, reliability and accessibility.
The logo was designed to be simple yet distinctive, incorporating elements that represent time spent on learning and growth.
As well as the name, Chronocademy, which combines the words ``chronos'' (latin for time) and ``academy'' to emphasize the platform's focus on real-time learning.
Slogans were thought to be a good match with the platform, such as ``Learn.
Teach.
Grow.'' These branding efforts were crucial for creating a meaningful identity with the target audience and set Chronocademy apart in the market.

\subsubsection{Color Palette}\label{subsubsec:color-palette}
The color palette for Chronocademy was chosen following the colors theory, which is

\begin{quote}
``a set of practices for picking colours together for harmonious designs and contextual combinations''
\end{quote}\cite{colorTheory}.

The first step was to decide which tone of colors would be used, and the team decided to use a mix of pastel colors, which are know for their calming and trustworthy interpretation and some warm colors to give a sense of energy and modern product.

Once this was defined, the team started to work on the style tiles, defined as:

\begin{quote}
``a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web
[\ldots]
They help form a common visual language between the designers and the stakeholders and provide a catalyst for discussions around the preferences and goals of the client.
[\ldots]
Style tiles establish a direct connection with actual interface elements without defining layout.
\end{quote}\cite{styleTiles}

This tool was helpful to come up with the final color palette and fonts that would be used in the platform.
Initially, three different style tiles were created, and the team decided to go with the one that had a mix of pastel and warm colors, as well as a modern and clean font.
All three versions were focused on the same concept of ``knowledgeable, reliable, and accessible''.

\subsection{Understanding the Problem: User Interviews and Feature Mapping}\label{subsec:understanding-the-problem:-user-interviews-and-feature-mapping}
To ensure that Chronocademy addressed a real and pressing need, the team conducted interviews with potential users.
This exploratory phase involved gathering insights from individuals who were interested in learning new skills or sharing their expertise.
The interviews revealed common pain points, such as the difficulty of finding reliable teachers, the high cost of learning platforms, and the challenges of managing multiple tools for teaching and learning.
Using the feedback from these interviews, the team mapped user needs into actionable features for the platform.
For instance, the need for affordability led to the time-based currency model, while the desire for seamless teaching experiences inspired the integration of scheduling and video conferencing tools.
This process ensured that every feature of Chronocademy was directly tied to solving a specific user problem.

\subsection{Prioritizing Features with the Lean Startup Approach}\label{subsec:prioritizing-features-with-the-lean-startup-approach}
Once the features were identified, the team prioritized them using the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) methodology from the Lean Startup approach.
This method emphasized building a version of Chronocademy that included only the essential features needed to deliver value to users and validate the concept.
Features such as the time-based credit system, user profiles, and scheduling integration were classified as high priority and included in the initial release.
Lower-priority features, such as advanced customization options or gamification elements, were placed on a roadmap for future iterations.
This approach allowed the team to focus on delivering a functional and impactful product in a shorter time frame while leaving room for growth and improvement based on user feedback.
