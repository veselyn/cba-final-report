\section{Product Development}\label{sec:productdevelopment}
The development of Chronocademy began by defining, refining, and prioritizing its core aspects and features.
This section outlines the step-by-step process undertaken to shape the product, ensuring it was both viable and aligned with the needs of its users.

\subsection{Defining the Idea through the Business Model Canvas}\label{subsec:business-model-canvas}
The first step in the product development journey was to define the core idea behind Chronocademy.
To structure and validate this concept, the team utilized the Business Model Canvas framework.

\begin{quote}
    ``The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management and entrepreneurial tool.
    It allows you to describe, design, challenge, invent, and pivot your business model.
    This method from the bestselling management book Business Model Generation is applied in leading organizations and start-ups worldwide.''
\end{quote}\cite{business-canvas-model}

This tool helped identify the key components of the platform, including the value proposition, target customer segments, revenue streams, and cost structure.
By analyzing these elements, the team was able to understand how Chronocademy would create, deliver, and capture value in a competitive landscape.
The structured approach of the Business Model Canvas ensured that the idea was not only innovative but also practical and sustainable.

\subsection{Establishing the Brand: Colors, Logo, and Slogans}\label{subsec:establishing-the-brand:-colors-logo-and-slogans}
With the foundation of the business model in place, the next focus was on establishing a unique and memorable brand identity for Chronocademy.
The team selected a color palette that reflected the platformâ€™s values of inclusivity, innovation, and growth.
The logo was designed to be simple yet distinctive, incorporating elements that symbolized knowledge exchange and collaboration.
Slogans were crafted to succinctly convey the mission of the platform, such as ``Learn.
Teach.
Grow.'' These branding efforts were crucial for creating a cohesive identity that resonated with the target audience and set Chronocademy apart in the market.

\subsection{Understanding the Problem: User Interviews and Feature Mapping}\label{subsec:understanding-the-problem:-user-interviews-and-feature-mapping}
To ensure that Chronocademy addressed a real and pressing need, the team conducted interviews with potential users.
This exploratory phase involved gathering insights from individuals who were interested in learning new skills or sharing their expertise.
The interviews revealed common pain points, such as the difficulty of finding reliable teachers, the high cost of learning platforms, and the challenges of managing multiple tools for teaching and learning.
Using the feedback from these interviews, the team mapped user needs into actionable features for the platform.
For instance, the need for affordability led to the time-based currency model, while the desire for seamless teaching experiences inspired the integration of scheduling and video conferencing tools.
This process ensured that every feature of Chronocademy was directly tied to solving a specific user problem.

\subsection{Prioritizing Features with the Lean Startup Approach}\label{subsec:prioritizing-features-with-the-lean-startup-approach}
Once the features were identified, the team prioritized them using the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) methodology from the Lean Startup approach.
This method emphasized building a version of Chronocademy that included only the essential features needed to deliver value to users and validate the concept.
Features such as the time-based credit system, user profiles, and scheduling integration were classified as high priority and included in the initial release.
Lower-priority features, such as advanced customization options or gamification elements, were placed on a roadmap for future iterations.
This approach allowed the team to focus on delivering a functional and impactful product in a shorter time frame while leaving room for growth and improvement based on user feedback.
